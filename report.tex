\section{Introduction}

A solar cell is an eletrical device that generates electricity by the photovoltaic effect. Upon exposure to illumination, the device creates voltage, which in turn gives rise to an electric current. Solar cells are becoming increasingly common as an alternative source of electricity. \\

A solar cell can be described as a $p-n$ junction, which is an interface between $p$-type material (acceptors) and $n$-type material (donors) inside a semiconductor. Electrons will diffuse from the $n$-side to the $p$-side, while holes will diffuse from the $p$-side to the $n$-side. At the same time, an electric field comes into existance between the diffused electrons at the $p$-side and the diffused holes at the $n$-side. Whereas the diffusion force pulls electrons to the $n$-side and holes to the $p$-side, the force from the built-in electric field will pull both electrons and holes in the opposite direction, counteracting the diffusion. Sooner or later the forces will be equal, and an equilibrium is established. \\

Free electron-hole pairs can be generated in a semiconductor when it is exposed to light with sufficient energy to excite electrons to the conduction band. If this happens close enough to the interface between the two sides, the electron and hole will feel the built-in electric field, and will consequently be swept in different directions. When the sides are shortcircuited, electrons will flow from the $n$-side to the $p$-side to recombine with the holes. This is how solar cells generate an electric current. Note that the direction is the opposite of a diode, because we have minority carriers instead of majority carriers.

\section{Experimental procedure}

We used a thin-film polycrystalline silicon solar cell in this laboration. By Kittel, the band gap of silicon is $E_g = 1.11 eV$ at $T = 300 K$. It follows that the minimum frequency needed for a monochromatic light source is

$$\nu_g = \frac{E_g}{h} = 2.68 \cdot 10^{14} Hz,$$

which corresponds to the wavelength $1100 nm$, which lies in the infrared spectrum. Thus, visible light will be able to drive the solar cell. \\

A Power Cassy was used to apply a selected voltage over the solar cell and measure the current output. The Power Cassy acted as an ideal voltage source. The area of the solar cell was $2.3 cm \times 6.0 cm$. The solar cell was placed under the light source, a $60$ W desk lamp, at distances varying between $12.5 cm$ and $62.5 cm$. \\

We first made a measurement with the lamp turned off and observed that the current was next to zero, as expected; see figure [ivsan] for reference. We next performed a measurement with the lamp turned on and observed a sine curve. This was also expected, since a standard wall outlet outputs an alternating current. \\

We now set the Power Cassy to produce triangular waves with amplitude $57 V$ and frequency $0.2 Hz$. Once again, we made measurements with the lamp turned off and then with the lamp turned on. We averaged the current $I_{av}$ over $10 ms$ to eliminate the sine like curve due to the wall outlet. \\

We finally measured the power delivered from the solar cell for each of the eleven distances. The power follows from the relation $P = I_{av} \cdot U$. The power delivered to the surface of the solar cell depends on the table-to-lamp distance $d$ as $P(d) = P_0/(d/d_0)^2$, where $P_0$ is a reference value of the power output calculated with the lamp at distance $d_0$ from the solar cell. While we only contemplated the maximal power, we noted that it depends on the total radiative power received...

\section{Discussion of the results}
The power delivered to the solar cell should of course satisfy $4\pi R^2\Phi = P$, where $P$ is the effect. (We measured the maximal effect $P_{max}$). Hence, if we fit the curve according to the formula $P_{max}=kf(d)/f(0)$, where $k$ is a proportional constant, $f(d)=\frac{1}{(d+x_0)^2}$ and $d$ the distance from the lamp to the solar cell, we should obtain something that is linear, see figure \ref{pmaxvsf}. We introduced $x_0$ in order to compensate for systematic errors and found that $k=1.76\cdot 10^{-6}$ wm${}^2$ and $x_0=4.98$ cm, however some differences still remain; some possibly arising from the fact that the lamp is not a perfect sphere.

As a way to check the results, consider the following: Approximate the solar cell together with the Power Cassy as a simple circuit, where the solar cell and the Power Cassy has resistance $R_0$ and $R$, respectively. 
By Ohm's law, we know that $U=RI$ and $P=IR^2$. Then, since $U_0=(R+R_0)I$, it follows that $P=RI^2=R\left( \frac{U_0}{R+R_0} \right)^2$.
The voltage at maximum power it therefore given by
\begin{displaymath}
  0=\frac{dP}{dR}=-\frac{U_0^2(R-R_0)}{(R+R_0)^3}\iff R=R_0.
\end{displaymath}

In this case, the voltage is also maximal and given by $U_{max}=R_0I=R_0\frac{U_0}{R_0+R_0}=\frac{U_0}{2}$.
From figure \ref{pvsv}, we see that $U_{max}\approx -0.4$ V and from figure \ref{ivsu}, we see that $U_0\approx 0.5$ V, which does not at all agree with theory.

The most ideal solar cell are of course those whose energy gap coincide with the sun. Now, from theory, we know that the maximum efficiency is given by $E_g/(k_BT)\approx 2.3$ and since the temperature of the photosphere is approximately $5800$ K, the best solar cells are those with an energy gap of around $1.15$ eV.
Our solar cell with an energy gap of around $1.11$ eV at $300$ K is therefore an excellent choice.

In this report, we considered a $60$ W light bulb with an effective temperature around $3000$ K. This implies that $E_g/(k_B T)\approx 4.3$ so that theory gives us a efficiency of $25$\%.
Also, we know that the theoretical upper limit for the efficiency $\eta=\frac{\text{output power}}{\text{input power}}$ is given by $\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\approx 2.3$.
Obviously, we do not reach $25$\%, in fact, it is considerably lower as the following shows.
The area of the solar cell was $13.8$ cm${}^2$ and as a rough approximation, assume that the wavelength of the $60$ W light bulb to is $1100$ nm. Then elementary physics implies that it emits approximately $3.3\cdot 10^{20}$ photons per second. Assuming that they are distributed spherically and perfectly aligns with the solar cell, at a distance of $37.5$ cm, $13.8/(4\pi 37.5^2)\approx 0.078 \%$ of the photons hit the solar cell.
Thus, the efficiency is 
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{0.078\cdot 10^{-2}\cdot 3.3\cdot 10^{20}\cdot 6.6\cdot 10^{-34}\cdot 3\cdot 10^8}{1100\cdot 10^{-9}\cdot 0.033 }\approx
\end{displaymath}
